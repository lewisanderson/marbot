The extraction and processing of these resources can have negative environmental impacts, including habitat destruction, water pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions.</li><li><strong>Energy Consumption:</strong> Plastic manufacturing is energy-intensive, requiring large amounts of electricity and other forms of energy. This leads to increased greenhouse gas emissions and contributes to climate change.</li><li><strong>Pollution: </strong>The production and disposal of plastic products can result in pollution of the air, water, and soil. Plastic waste can also harm wildlife and ecosystems, as well as contribute to the buildup of non-biodegradable waste in landfills and the ocean.</li><li><strong>Health Hazards:</strong> Plastic manufacturing can also pose health hazards to workers who are exposed to toxic chemicals during the production process.</li><li><strong>End-of-Life Management:</strong> The disposal of plastic products at the end of their useful life is a major challenge, as plastic waste can take hundreds of years to decompose.
